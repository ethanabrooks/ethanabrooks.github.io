abstract = {Learning to flexibly follow task instructions in dynamic environments poses interesting challenges for
reinforcement learning agents. We focus here on the problem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict
step-by-step execution of instructions{—}that is, control flow that may skip forward over parts of the instructions or
return backward to previously completed or skipped steps. Demand for such flexible control arises in two fundamental
ways: explicitly when control is specified in the instructions themselves (such as conditional branching and looping)
and implicitly when stochastic environment dynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been
perturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already present. We formulate an attention-based
architecture that meets these challenges by learning, from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and condition
behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions. We test the architecture’s ability to learn both explicit and
implicit control in two illustrative domains—one inspired by Minecraft and the other by StarCraft—and show that the
architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization to novel instructions of length greater than those in a training set, at
a performance level unmatched by three baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation architecture.}
