I am a machine learning researcher working at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Foundation Models. In particular I develop methods for using semi-supervised learning in offline datasets to improve online in-context reinforcement learning. My goal is to find ways for models to acquire useful prior knowledge and to combine this with a capacity to adapt to novel settings through exploration. I completed my dissertation at the University of Michigan where I studied with Satinder Singh and Rick Lewis.
