    I am a machine learning researcher in the subdiscipline of deep
    reinforcement learning. I connected with this field through my
    encounters with empiricist philosophy in college. I believe that reinforcement
    learning and deep learning supply compelling answers to the
    centuries-old question of how human beings learn to make sense of the

    of sensory experience and learn to thrive in our
    infinitely
    chaotic reality.

    My research interests focus on the intersection of reinforcement learning and natural
    language. I am interested in leveraging large data sets and the supervised
    models trained on them (e.g. GPT-X) to improve reinforcement learning. I am also
    interested in the role of reinforcement learning in discovering both natural
    language and structured programming languages (program synthesis). Finally, I am
    interested in understanding the limits of language in capturing actionable
    knowledge.
