I am a machine learning researcher in the subdiscipline of deep
reinforcement learning. I discovered and fell in love with this field through my
encounters with empiricist philosophy in college. I believe that reinforcement
learning and deep learning supply compelling answers to the
centuries-old question of how human beings learn to make sense of the "blooming,
buzzing confusion" of sensory experience and learn to thrive in our infinitely
chaotic reality.

My interests focus on the intersection of reinforcement learning and natural
language. I am interested in leveraging large data sets and the supervised
models trained on them (e.g. GPT-X) to improve reinforcement learning. I am also
interested in the role of reinforcement learning in discovering both natural
language and structured programming languages (program synthesis). Finally, I am
interested in understanding the limits of language in capturing actionable
knowledge.
