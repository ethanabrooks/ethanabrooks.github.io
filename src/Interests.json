"My interests focus on the intersection of reinforcement learning and natural language. I am interested in leveraging large data sets and the supervised models trained on them (e.g. GPT-X) to improve reinforcement learning. I am also interested in the role of reinforcement learning in discovering both natural language and structured programming languages (program synthesis). Finally, I am interested in understanding the limits of language in capturing actionable knowledge."
